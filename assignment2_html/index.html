                My name is Georgia Mei Carter. I spent half of my childhood growing up in Japan, where I found a passion
                for sharing culture, history, and experiences through cuisine. Today I would like to introduce my idea
                for a Japanese style izakaya, or bar and grill.
            </p>

                 Gakuen is an

                 concept. It will serve Japanese-American fusion cuisine and
                include a merchandise shop at the entrance, not unlike the American restaurant Cracker Barrel.

            <h3>Customer Demographic</h3>
            <p class="para">
                Since the emergence of streaming platforms, western interest in Japanese culture has boomed alongside a
                growing population of anime, J-pop, and Japanese drama fans. These fans of Japanese culture as well as
                fans of other genre media will be the main demographic, but like an authentic izakaya, my restaurant
                will also cater to parties who would appreciate spending time together over a meal. The bar/grill
                section of my establishment will include typical restaurant dining tables as well as traditional izakaya
                tables that are low to the ground and include a space underneath the table to hang your legs when
                sitting on the floor. Like an izakaya, the menus will mostly be comprised of shareable items, and we
                will provide all you can eat/drink options which will be charged per person, applied to the entire
                party. The gift shop will include manga and western comic books, official manga and anime merchandise,
                anime, movie, and vintage American cartoon DVDs, imported drinks and snacks, and vintage arcade style
                videogames and pinball machines. Food prices will be slightly higher but this and revenue from the gift
                shop will be directed towards paying servers a livable wage, so that in turn tips will not be necessary
                and servers will be less concerned about quickly turning tables. This will encourage people to visit my
                restaurant if they wish to spend an extended amount of time sharing dishes with family and friends.

            <h3>Customer Relationship</h3>
            <h5>
                We will host several special events for fans of specific interests, such as:
            </h5>

               <!--Unordered List-->
               <ul>
                <li>Anime and movie trivia nights</li>
                <li>Merchandise release specials </li>

            <h5>
                 In appreciation for late night drivers and deliverers, we will
                offer late night discounts for anybody who can show proof of completing an Uber/Lyft ride or a food
                delivery after 10pm.
            </h5>
            
            <h3>Marketing Channels</h3>
            <p class="para">
                Upon the establishment of my restaurant, I will host an opening party and invite prominent social media
                figures that focus on anime/tv commentary, Japanese culture/history, travel, cooking, and dining, in
                exchange for promotion of my business on their platforms. I will establish social media accounts on
                various platforms and pay a higher rate to restaurant employees who are passionate about the business
                and have ample experience in the respective platforms to run these accounts. We will promote our focus
                on sharing dishes with discount party bundles and encourage spending time in the gift shop with in-store
                rewards to those who can beat highest-records on our arcade games. On the company website, we will
                include pages to purchase merchandise. It will incorporate a third-party POS system such as
                <!--External Link-->
                <a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/restaurant-pos/full-service-pos-system" target="_blank">Toast Tab</a>
                so that online reservations and orders may be directly delivered to in-store staff. There will be a group
                of employees and a small kitchen on the basement floor designated for pick-up and delivery orders so as
                not to overwhelm the kitchen. We will offer our items through Uber Eats and Door Dash, but we will also
                have a small group of delivery staff and offer discount items to customers that order for in-store
                pick-up or delivery through our website rather than these third-party platforms.
