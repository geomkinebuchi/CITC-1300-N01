            <h3>All You Can Eat Specials</h3>
            <p class="para">
                Five nights out of the week, Gakuen will have a different all you can eat specials. These are aimed at
                attracting business on slower nights out of the week and will occur Sunday night-Monday night during
                happy hour. Thursday and Sunday nights can be expected to be slightly busier than Monday-Wednesday and
                will therefore consist of kitchen-prepared items. Monday-Wednesday nights can be expected to be the
                slowest nights of the week and will therefore be interactive dining nights. Food preparation should
                begin early in the mornings with an employee designated for all you can eat items. Meat and fish should
                be placed in the walk-in cooler to thaw on the day before. Poultry should be thawed two days before and
                placed in brine the day before its use. For interactive dining items, ingredients should be cleaned,
                cut, and portioned. All you can eat nights will be as follows:

                usual so that it will be relatively more satiating. Prepare fresh wasabi, teriyaki glaze, pickled
                ginger, and other toppings such as thinly sliced onions, Masago, tenkasu, and thinly sliced cheese,
                which can be served torched on sushi.
