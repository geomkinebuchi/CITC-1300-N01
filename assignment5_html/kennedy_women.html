            <div class="info">The tragic pattern of women marrying into the Kennedy family who later face accusations of
                being unstable or addicted, followed by their untimely deaths, paints a deeply disturbing picture of the
                family's dynamic. Often, these women were publicly labeled as "crazy" or "addicts" when they expressed
                dissatisfaction or distress about the mistreatment they suffered within the family, particularly from
                their powerful husbands. Such labels, typically employed to discredit and silence them, mask the deeper
                issue of emotional and psychological abuse that they endured. Tragically, many of these women, like Mary
                Richardson Kennedy and others, later died from overdoses or suicide, their deaths often described as the
                final acts of a life in crisis. This phenomenon suggests a darker side of the Kennedy family legacy,
                where the public and media narratives surrounding these women's struggles played a significant role in
                their demise, turning their suffering into a tragic spectacle while failing to address the true sources
                of their pain. It raises questions about how the family's power and influence may have contributed to
                the isolation and eventual deaths of these women, masking the reality of their tragic fates.</div>
