            <div class="info">The theory surrounding John F. Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and UFOs presents a fascinating
                and chilling narrative, one that suggests the tragic deaths of both figures were connected to a larger,
                hidden truth about extraterrestrial encounters. JFK, in his later years, is believed to have become
                increasingly aware of the government's secret dealings with UFO phenomena and extraterrestrial life,
                including the knowledge that advanced technology was being kept from the public. Marilyn Monroe,
                according to this theory, became involved with JFK as a result of his connections to powerful figures
                within the government and military who were in possession of this secret information. As Monroe
                allegedly knew too much about the government's hidden dealings with UFOs, her mysterious death is viewed
                as a targeted elimination by those who wanted to silence her, and possibly JFK, to protect the
                information from reaching the public. JFK's assassination is often linked to this, with some theorists
                suggesting that his desire to expose the truth about UFOs and end the secrecy surrounding it could have
                been the very reason he was killed. In this theory, the tragic deaths of both figures are not random
                acts, but part of a larger conspiracy to keep the public in the dark about the existence of
                extraterrestrial life and advanced technologies.</div>
