                <h2>Satanic Bloodlines</h2>
                <p> The Kennedy family has longstanding ties with the illuminati, going back to the origins of their
                    lineage. The first Kennedy is thought to be Brain Caeneddi of Ireland and his nephew who spelled the
                    family name “Cinneidi.” Brian Caeneddi has many descendants throughout several royal families
                    associated
                    with the illuminati at this time, when the family name soon became O'Kennedy. Originally a
                    Dalcassion
                    sept, the Killokennedy parish remains an artifact of their habitation in Kallahoe, before the
                    O'Brians
                    and MacNamaras forced them into other territories—where they became the Lords of Ormond in what is
                    now
                    Tipperary—and remained powerful until the 16th century.</p>

                <p>They originally were a Dalcassion sept, and were in the area near Killahoe, and Killokennedy parish
                    is a
                    reminder of that ancient fact. The O'Briens and MacNamaras forced them into new territories where
                    they
                    became the Lords of Ormond--what is now north Tipperary. Most Kennedys in Ireland today are still
                    found
                    in that area. The Kennedys remained powerful into the 16th century.</p>
                <br>

                <p>In more contemporary history, three long-term girlfriends of JFK—Marilyn Monroe, Jane Mansfield, and
                    Zsa Zsa Gabor—are known to have also dated Anton LaVey, a head of the Church of Satan. There is
                    record that Mansfield acted as high priestess of the church for a time, and Monroe was a participant
                    in LaVey's satanic rituals before the church was founded. </p>

                <p>California had a reputation of acceptance surrounding Satanic practices, hosting voodoo-practicing
                    Haitian communities as well as witches and Satanists fleeing from regions where satanic practices
                    were not tolerated such as France, South America, and Cuba. </p>
                <p>Anton LaVey's maternal grandmother was from Transylvania, and it is beleived that she is the one who
                    encouraged his interest in the occult. While in Claifornia, LaVey joined the Clyde Beatty Circus,
                    where he worked the occult side shows. The Beatty family also has connections to illuminati
                    bloodlines. </p>
                <p>Anton LaVey's Church of Satan has links with MK slave handling trade, with recruits know to have
                    social relationships with JFK, such as Frank Sinatra, Peter Lawford, and Sammy Davis, Jr. Frank
                    Sinatra, Peter Lawford, and Sammy Davis, Jr. Anton LaVey was an MK ULTRA handler who programmed
                    Monroe and Mansfield to be Beta Kittens. </p>
