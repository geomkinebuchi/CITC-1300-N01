    <h1>General Motors Owns Your World</h1>
    <p>If you drive a Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac, or Buick, then GM owns your car's company. This means that up until
        January, if you were a user of their OnStar Smart Driving feature, your geolocation and driving behavior data
        were likely being

            target="_blank">sold to consumer reporting agencies</a>
        without your knowledge. It means that the company that owns your car is
        currently lobbying against
        <!--External Link-->
        <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/906/text" target="_blank">a bill in
            congress</a>
        that would ensure your "right to repair" by mandating that any
        data generated by your vehicle's software be accessible to you and anybody of your choosing at any time.
        This includes vehicle diagnostics, vital repair information, wear, and calibration data; the bill seeks to
        make this data available so that your car's company cannot control when you seek vehicle maintenance, where
        you receive maintenance, or what companies you chose to supply any parts or tools fromâ€”and GM is fighting to
        not relinquish this control.
    </p>
    <p>It's not just your car; if you have a Frigidaire washer, dryer, or dishwasher, GM owns your appliances
        too. If you live in Detroit and gaze upon the Renaissance Center standing against the river, GM owns your
        skyline too, and is currently threatening to

            target="_blank">demolish your city </a>
        if they do not receive a tax grant to renovate their
        properties.
        Then of course, if you ever wish that you had no need for a car and could instead rely upon public
        transit to
        take you to work or school, know that GM took this opportunity from you and made your ability to go
        anywhere
        contingent on their product... If you look through America's history you will find General Motors
        painted across
        it, just as significantly as presidents, bills, and wars. They control your present and shape your
        future, even
        if you do not own any of their products; this is their modern monopoly, a monopoly on your life.

    <h2>General Motors' History</h2>
    <p>The more you learn about General Motors' history, the more you know about American history. The company's history
        is long, and it includes some rather influential individuals as well. The following is a list of sources that
        paint a comprehensive picture of it as you compare what is recounted, and what isn't, in each telling of General
        Motors' story.</p>

            <p>Wikipedia is an excellent beginning to a research journey. GM's profile is listed in great detail here,
                and you can use listed references to find more concrete biographies or look deeper into topics that
                catch your attention. </p>

            <p>There is a lot that can be gleaned from what a person says about themselves when asked to talk about
                their background. Corporations are the same; for a company with such a long history, what does General
                Motors include and what do they omit when retelling it themselves?</p>

            <p>The founder of General Motors, William Crapo Durand, was a very interesting person with a very
                interesting life. Looking at the people and practices that began such a cataclysmic corporation can shed
                light onto the morals and methodology the company we know today. I found this form nominating Durand's
                original Durant-Dort Carriage Company Office for the National Register of Historic Places Inventory a
                particularly intriguing and in-depth biographical source, among many others.</p>

    <h3>It Could Have Been Great</h3>

    <p>General Motors would not be where it is today without their conspiracy to end public transportation.
        Before the
        second World War only one in ten Americans owned a car and the rest didn't need one, but GM created a
        market for
        their product by buying and replacing electric streetcars with motorized buses, then smothering the
        budget of
        this system until it could no longer be used, at which point they offered a glamorous solution: personal
        vehicles to take the modern, independent American anywhere you may need to go. The documentary
        <!--External Link-->
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-I8GDklsN4&list=LL" target="_blank">"Taken For a Ride"</a>
        tells this story in first-hand detail, and now can only be found on YouTube. I recommend watching it to
        find out why grass grows over train tracks in your town and the bus is never on time; this is history
        you deserve to know before it is slowly etched off of the face of the internet.
