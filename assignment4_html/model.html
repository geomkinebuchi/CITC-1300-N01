                        My name is Georgia Mei Carter. I spent half of my childhood growing up in Japan, where I found a
                        passion
                        for sharing culture, history, and experiences through cuisine. Today I would like to introduce
                        my
                        idea
                        for a Japanese style izakaya, or bar and grill.

                        include a merchandise shop at the entrance, not unlike the American restaurant Cracker Barrel.

                    <h3>Customer Demographic</h3>
                    <p class="para">
                        Since the emergence of streaming platforms, western interest in Japanese culture has boomed
                        alongside a
                        growing population of anime, J-pop, and Japanese drama fans. These fans of Japanese culture
                        as
                        well
                        as
                        fans of other genre media will be the main demographic, but like an authentic izakaya, my
                        restaurant
                        will also cater to parties who would appreciate spending time together over a meal. The
                        bar/grill
                        section of my establishment will include typical restaurant dining tables as well as
                        traditional
                        izakaya
                        tables that are low to the ground and include a space underneath the table to hang your legs
                        when
                        sitting on the floor. Like an izakaya, the menus will mostly be comprised of shareable
                        items,
                        and we
                        will provide all you can eat/drink options which will be charged per person, applied to the
                        entire
                        party. The gift shop will include manga and western comic books, official manga and anime
                        merchandise,
                        anime, movie, and vintage American cartoon DVDs, imported drinks and snacks, and vintage
                        arcade
                        style
                        videogames and pinball machines. Food prices will be slightly higher but this and revenue
                        from
                        the
                        gift
                        shop will be directed towards paying servers a livable wage, so that in turn tips will not
                        be
                        necessary
                        and servers will be less concerned about quickly turning tables. This will encourage people
                        to
                        visit
                        my
                        restaurant if they wish to spend an extended amount of time sharing dishes with family and
                        friends.

            <h3>Marketing Channels</h3>
            <p class="para">
                Upon the establishment of my restaurant, I will host an opening party and invite prominent social media
                figures that focus on anime/tv commentary, Japanese culture/history, travel, cooking, and dining, in
                exchange for promotion of my business on their platforms. I will establish social media accounts on
                various platforms and pay a higher rate to restaurant employees who are passionate about the business
                and have ample experience in the respective platforms to run these accounts. We will promote our focus
                on sharing dishes with discount party bundles and encourage spending time in the gift shop with in-store
                rewards to those who can beat highest-records on our arcade games. On the company website, we will
                include pages to purchase merchandise. It will incorporate a third-party POS system such as
                <!--External Link-->
                <a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/restaurant-pos/full-service-pos-system" target="_blank">Toast Tab</a>
                so that online reservations and orders may be directly delivered to in-store staff. There will be a
                group
                of employees and a small kitchen on the basement floor designated for pick-up and delivery orders so as
                not to overwhelm the kitchen. We will offer our items through Uber Eats and Door Dash, but we will also
                have a small group of delivery staff and offer discount items to customers that order for in-store
                pick-up or delivery through our website rather than these third-party platforms.
