            <h2>Concept Story</h2>
            <div class="para">
                <p>As a young child, my family couldn't afford to go on many family trips, but my parents would take my
                    siblings and I out for dinner every other Sunday as a family treat. Before I moved to Japan towards
                    the
                    end of elementary school, one of my favorite restaurants that we would go to was Crackel Barrel Old
                    Country Store. I don't remember much about the food, but I have fond memories of playing the peg
                    game
                    with my brothers at the table while we waited for our food and begging my mother to buy us one of
                    the
                    old-fashioned candies from the gift shop as we left. </p>
                <p>Once we moved to Japan the frequency that we would go out waned; instead, every few months we would
                    have
                    dinner with our entire extended family at one of the izakaya's that surrounded the train stations
                    near
                    our homes. This is where I learned the joy of ordering countless small dishes to pass around the
                    table
                    and share with your loved ones. </p>
                <p>As adults, we all have very dear friends and family that we do not get to see or speak to nearly
                    enough
                    in our daily lives, but just one dinner together can make it seem as if no time has passed since the
                    last. </p>
                <p>Good food holds heritage and history, care and thoughtfulness, sacrifice and rejuvenation. With
                    Gakuen,
                    my hope is to provide opportunities for people to grow closer through experiences—as every shared
                    dish
                    becomes part of a shared memory and clean plates join history with the ones that came before them, I
                    aim
                    to create a moment where cultures meet to draw people towards one another. </p>

            <h2>My Professional Background</h2>
            <div class="para">
                <p>I have a longstanding history of working in food service but for me, cooking has and will continue to
                    be
                    a lifetime experience. I became the central home caregiver for my brothers when I was very young,
                    and
                    from the beginning of my cooking for them I took great pride in my meticulous utilization of local
                    and
                    seasonal ingredients to create satisfying, nutrient dense meals with limited time and resources.
                </p>
                <p>I entered the hospitality industry as a server when I was fifteen, which is where I fell in love with
                    customer service. Strategic problem solving and observational awareness are two of my biggest
                    strengths
                    and in this position, I was able to quickly grow my communication skills to match, becoming
                    extremely
                    adept at anticipating and resolving the needs of my guests—often before such even came to their
                    attention—while providing a warm and enthusiastic approachable demeanor. </p>
                <p>Ever a proactive worker, I soon learned to work in the kitchen as well—a practice I have continued
                    throughout every restaurant I have worked in since—and not only increased my versatility as an
                    employee
                    but also expanded my insight into the functions of the business to be more well-rounded. </p>
                <p>Eventually this paid off, as I took up a management position at a diner that was reopening after
                    bankruptcy. Having worked nearly every labor position in a restaurant and having been the first
                    person
                    hired to the management team, I was in an excellent position to tweak the systematic functions of
                    the
                    restaurant and business model to optimize production and service, revamping the business came back
                    into
                    fruition. As a result, store sales tripled over the first six months of my employment and labor
                    margins
                    dropped by over 10%. I communicated well with my employees and understood that meeting their needs
                    was
                    just as essential as meeting those of our guests, and the relationships I cultivated with them
                    allowed
                    us to meet every challenge in unity, with excellent coordination and methodology. </p>
                <p>As cooking, serving, and leading have become increasingly robust pillars of my professional
                    experience, I
                    have set my heart on opening a restaurant of my own. My background is foundational to the passion
                    that I
                    have for this goal and gives me confidence as I take on its monumental challenge. </p>
